# Bluetooth SPP WebWorks Plugin #


This Bluetooth SPP WebWorks Plugin (**SimpleBtSppPlugin**) is intended to allow  WebWorks applications to connect to devices that uses the Bluetooth SPP profile.

There is a document in the **/documents** folder describing the plugin's API from JavaScript.

It comes with a sample WebWorks application in the form of a simple **Chat** application that uses SPP to communicate between two BlackBerry 10 devices.

## The Plugin ##

The plugin itself is located in this repo here:

	<repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/plugin

There is a sample application that uses thus plugin in this repo here:

	<repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/sample

Clone this repo to your local machine.

You have the choice of immediately using the plugin, which has been built against **10.2.1**, or, building the plugin yourself -- you may want to do this to enable access to the RFCOMM API additions that become available in **10.3.0**. In this case just import the project at this path:

	<repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/plugin/src/blackberry10/native

into Momentics and build it against the SDK of your choice (**10.2.1** or **10.3.0**) for **both** ***device*** and ***simulator*** targets.

The sample code for this plugin and application is Open Source under 
the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

## The Sample Application ##

If you want to run the sample Chat application here's what you need to do. You have two options.

### Install the pre-built and signed version ###

There is a pre-built, signed, release build of the application in the folder: 

	<repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/installable-bar-files

It's built using the plugin as built against 10.2.1. 

### Build it yourself ###

You'll need to re-create the project using the latest templates and plugins and then simply add the application specific code to your project. 

Ensure the [BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK 2.1](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk) is correctly installed. I used this version of WebWorks but you may be using a newer version when you build this project: 

	```
	> webworks -v
	v2.1.0.13
	```

Open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac) in a folder of your choosing and follow the following instructions:

- Create a new WebWorks project in a folder of your own choosing. I'll call it `<SAMPLE>` in what follows.
- `cd <SAMPLE>` and create a WebWorks project in this folder something like:

	```
	webworks create mytest com.sample.mytest "My Test"
	```

- `cd mytest` and replace the whole ***www*** folder at:

	```
	<SAMPLE>/mytest/www
	```
	
	with the one at:

	```
	<repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/sample/www
	```

- Add the Bluetooth plugin using this command: 

	```
	webworks plugin add <repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/plugin
	```	

- You can verify that the plugin is installed correctly

	```
	webworks plugin ls
	``` 

- Build and run the sample application on an attached device using:

	```
	webworks run
	```

- If you change the plugin you will need to remove it and add it again using:

	```
	webworks plugin remove com.blackberry.community.simplebtspplugin
	```
	```
	webworks plugin add <repo>/SimpleBtSppPlugin/plugin
	```
