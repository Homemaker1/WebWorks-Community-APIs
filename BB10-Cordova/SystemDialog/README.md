## Including the feature in your application

This API can be installed from source or from the [Cordova Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/). Installation from the registry is done through the following:

## How to build your native Plugin

1.  Clone this repo to your local machine

2.  Ensure the [BlackBerry 10 Native SDK](https://developer.blackberry.com/native/download/sdk) is correctly installed

3.  Import the native extension project into momentics. It is located at `/plugin/src/blackberry10/native` within **this project**

4.  Build the native extension project for all architectures: Right click on the project and choose "Build Configurations" > "Build All"

Note: When build on the Mac/Linux platform, you will have the build directory contents as shown below. The "libSysDialog.so" is a symlink to the actual shared object "libSysDialog.so.1.0.0" in order to manage build version. Thus copying your build to the Windows platform and adding the plugin will NOT work. You need to rebuild on Windows, or remove the symlinks and rename you shared object "libSysDialog.so.1.0.0" to "libSysDialog.so".

	lrwxr-xr-x   libSysDialog.so@ -> libSysDialog.so.1.0.0
	lrwxr-xr-x   libSysDialog.so.1@ -> libSysDialog.so.1.0.0
	lrwxr-xr-x   libSysDialog.so.1.0@ -> libSysDialog.so.1.0.0
	-rwxr-xr-x   libSysDialog.so.1.0.0*


## Using the Plugin in an Application

To use the plugin in another project, that's been created with Cordova, run __cordova plugin add <path to the SysDialog folder>/plugin__.

All the methods in the plugin will be prefixed by that feature name, so a method called _show()_ supplied in the _community.sysdialog_ plugin will be called in JavaScript like so:

community.sysdialog.show();
