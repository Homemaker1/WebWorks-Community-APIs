# AccountEmailID Cordova/Webworks Plugin

The purpose of this BlackBerry 10 Cordova/Webworks plugin is to allow a BlackBerry 10 Cordova app to retrieve 
the email address of the emails accounts setup on the device. This can be used to identify a user automatically or to 
auto-populate a user's email address in form fields. This extension cannot retrieve the account infomation(email address)
from the opposite space/perimeter. In other words, app using this extension cannot pull email addresses of the
work/enterprise space from the personal space, and vice versa.

**How to Build Device Emails for BB10 Webworks 2.0 **

Note: It is not necessary to build this project if you do not intend to modify the extension. The plugin folder already has a built copy of the
extension, simply install it. 

Assumption: You have installed the BlackBerry Native SDK 2.0+, and BlackBerry Webworks 2.0+

1. Simply import the plugin/src/blackberry10/native directory into a workspace into Momentics. Build the project. 
2. Go to the your WebWorks/Cordova App directory, then add the plugin using the following command: cordova plugin add ../plugin/
3. Now you can build the project using : webworks build --release  

**How can I know that this plugin actually works without building it all myself!**

If you don't want to build this sample application yourself we've included a pre-built and signed BAR file. 
You can find it in the folder /build folder. 


**Tested on**

1. Z30 running v10.2


**Known Issues**
Cordova 3.4 now keeps it config.xml in a different location than the previous version(3.3).
WebWorks 2.0 Gold now keeps it's config.xml like version 3.4 of Cordova in the /www
folder. The sample project AccountEmailID-AppDemo has it's config.xml outside the /www folder so it will
work with WebWorks 2.0. The plugin will work with Cordova 3+ or WebWorks 2.0+ but 
to package the sample project the config.xml will need to be moved into the AccountEmailID-AppDemo folder for it to work with Cordova 3.3 and below. 
This does not effect the plugin, and is only in reference to the sample project.
