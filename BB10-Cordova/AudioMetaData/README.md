#AudioMetaData Cordova/Webworks Plugin

This plugin is designed to be able to retrive the ID3 tag of a MP3 file. This tag contains information for the file such as title, genre, artist, year of production, track number on the album etc. For more info visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3">here</a> for more information.

```
Right click on the imported project and choose properties.
Drop down C/C++ Build and choose Settings
Navigate to Tool Settings tab and choose Libraries under QCC Linker
 1. press add in Library Path(the file with gree + icon) and navigate to plugin/src/blackberry10/native/extlib
 2. press add in Libraries(Same icon as above) and type "id3v2" without the quotes.
```

####Loading the plugin

Simply open up a terminal and perform the following commands while in your application path:

````
webworks plugin add path/to/AudioMetaData plugin/plugin
```

#####However the following permissions must be applied to config.xml of you application

```
<rim:permissions>

</rim:permissions></pre>
```

##Calling The Extraction Functions

Currently the only function to call in the plugin is

````
audioMetaDataGetMetaData(path, callBack);
````
where:
````
path: The path to your mp3 file
callBack: The callback function to handle the data returned. eg: retrievedData(data)
````

````
audioMetaDataSetTagData(input);
````
where:
````
input: a json object containing the following information
  "path": path to the file
  "title": changing title
  "genre": changing genre
  "track": changing track number
  "year": changing year of the production of the song
  "album": changing album of the song
  "artist": changing the artist of the song

Follow is an example to change the songs title and artist

var data = { "path":"path/to/my/file.mp3", "title":"very nice", "artist":"yours truly" }
````

````
audioMetaDataRemoveTag(path);
````
where:
````
path: The path to your mp3 file
````

###Tested on

Z10 running v10.2

Note: Some error occurring in reading some mp3 files, this could be the problem with the library it self. This needs more investigation.
