# Contributing A BlackBerry 10 Plugin for PhoneGap, Cordova, and WebWorks 2.0

Start with the [Template](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/tree/master/BB10-Cordova/Template) sample to learn how plugins work and use it to generate a new project for you to start from.

## Plugins now published to NPM

With Cordova 5.0, plugins are now hosted in NPM, and we have published our plugins there as well. Follow the instructions in the readme for the plugin you want to add. It's as simple as typing

```
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-bb-app
```

on the command line while in your project directory, to add the BlackBerry 10 App plugin for example.
